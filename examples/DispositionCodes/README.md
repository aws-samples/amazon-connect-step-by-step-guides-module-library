## Disposition Use Case:
* The disposition codes example shows how you can use step-by-step guides to have agents provide disposition codes at the end of their call. Agents can provide basic information about the call and tag it based on a set of pre-defined tags. 
* This example will allow you to choose from "Customer was happy" or "Customer was sad." These tags can be manually edited within the Show View block.
* Once form is submitted, you can assign the contact attribute to the **Related contact** and it will appear in your original contact. 

## Views Used:
* Form
* Confirmation
