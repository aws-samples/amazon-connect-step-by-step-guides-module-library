# Disposition Codes Example

## Description
The disposition codes example provides a complete implementation of how you can use step-by-step guides to have agents provide disposition codes at the end of their call. Agents can provide basic information about the call and tag it based on a set of pre-defined tags. These tags can be manually edited within the Show View block.

## How to use
